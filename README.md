# Pull Request Template

We believe that crafting good code is not enough. Programming is about being disclipined. Pull Requests are an extension of this value when it comes to collaborative programming.

This document is a standard for raising Pull Requests for any of Skcript's repos on Github. 

## How to use:
1. Click on the file [PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md](https://github.com/skcript/PR-Template/blob/master/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md)
2. Click on [Raw](https://github.com/skcript/PR-Template/raw/master/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md)
3. Copy the contents of the page
4. Create a new file in your repo called PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md
5. Paste the content you copied earlier

## Format:

This PR template follows a specific format that works well for [Skcript](https://www.skcript.com). But it could vary from one organization to the other.

**Proposed Changes**
